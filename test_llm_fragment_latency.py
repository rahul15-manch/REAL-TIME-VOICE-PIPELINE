"""
Checkpoint: Realistic LLM-fragment latency test.

Groq (Pillar 3) will NOT hand you full, tidy sentences. It streams text
in short bursts as tokens arrive. This test measures your TTFB against
fragments that actually resemble that pattern, instead of one long
polished sentence — which is what we tested before and is NOT
representative of production traffic.

Run with:
    python -m tests.test_llm_fragment_latency
