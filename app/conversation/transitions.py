"""
Conversation State Transitions — The single source of truth for the FSM.

Design Decision:
    The transition map is a module-level constant (frozenset values inside a
    dict) so it is immutable at runtime.  Every transition in the system is
    validated against this map — no ad-hoc checks scattered across code.

    ConversationState is a *separate* enum from session.SessionState because
    the conversation FSM is more granular (10 states vs 6).  The session
    layer tracks coarse lifecycle; the conversation layer tracks the
    detailed pipeline flow.  A mapping function is provided for integration.

Transition Rules:
    IDLE               → LISTENING, CLOSED
    LISTENING          → TRANSCRIBING, INTERRUPTED, ERROR, CLOSED
    TRANSCRIBING       → THINKING, ERROR, CLOSED
    THINKING           → GENERATING_RESPONSE, ERROR, CLOSED
    GENERATING_RESPONSE→ GENERATING_AUDIO, ERROR, CLOSED
    GENERATING_AUDIO   → SPEAKING, ERROR, CLOSED
    SPEAKING           → LISTENING, INTERRUPTED, IDLE, ERROR, CLOSED
    INTERRUPTED        → LISTENING, CLOSED
    ERROR              → IDLE, CLOSED
    CLOSED             → (terminal — no outgoing transitions)

    Attributes:
        IDLE:                 No active processing; awaiting user input.
        LISTENING:            Microphone open, audio streaming to STT.
        TRANSCRIBING:         STT is converting buffered audio to text.
        THINKING:             LLM is processing the transcript.
        GENERATING_RESPONSE:  LLM is streaming response tokens.
        GENERATING_AUDIO:     TTS is synthesising audio from text.
        SPEAKING:             Audio is being played back to the user.
        INTERRUPTED:          User barged in during AI speech.
        ERROR:                A recoverable error occurred in the pipeline.
