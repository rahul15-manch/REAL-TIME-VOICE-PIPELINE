company_faq.py

Loads company FAQ knowledge base from the database and formats it as a
text block that can be appended to VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT, so the LLM can
answer company-related customer questions accurately instead of guessing.

FAQ data is cached in memory after being loaded once from the DB (via
refresh_faq_cache(), called at app startup), so the hot call path
(get_faq_context_block) stays synchronous and fast — no DB query per call.

Usage:
    from app.llm.company_faq import get_faq_context_block, refresh_faq_cache
    # at startup:
    await refresh_faq_cache()
    # per call:
    full_prompt = VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT + "\n\n" + get_faq_context_block()
