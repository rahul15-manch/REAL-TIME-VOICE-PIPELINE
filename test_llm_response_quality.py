"""
Quality check: generate real speech from a realistic LLM-style response
and save it so you can LISTEN and judge accuracy/naturalness yourself.

This is different from the latency tests — those measure SPEED.
This one measures QUALITY: does it sound right, is pronunciation
correct, does it handle punctuation/numbers/names naturally.

Run with:
    python -m tests.test_llm_response_quality
