## Repository Architecture
The architecture is structured across three core pillars:
- **Pillar 1**: AI Orchestration (Session Management, Pipeline Builder, Event Bus, Pipecat Adapter)
- **Pillar 2**: Transport Layer (Daily.co WebRTC, Twilio FastAPI WebSockets)
- **Pillar 3**: AI Services (Deepgram STT, Groq LLM, ElevenLabs TTS)

## Milestone-by-Milestone Progress
## Milestone 1 — Session Management Layer

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/session/` — Core session lifecycle and conversation state management

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `state.py` | `SessionState` enum — 6 states (IDLE → LISTENING → THINKING → SPEAKING → INTERRUPTED → CLOSED) with `is_active()` / `is_terminal()` helpers |
| `message.py` | Frozen `Message` dataclass — immutable, validated, LLM-API-compatible `to_dict()` |
| `models.py` | Mutable `Session` dataclass — UUID, timestamps, history, speaking flags, metadata, latency |
| `manager.py` | `SessionManager` — thread-safe CRUD, conversation ops, state transitions, Loguru logging |
| `__init__.py` | Package API surface with `__all__` exports |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **`Literal["system", "user", "assistant"]` for Role** — Serializes directly to LLM chat-completion format without `.value` calls. Chose Literal over Enum deliberately.

2. **`frozen=True` on Message, mutable Session** — Messages are immutable once created (thread-safe, referentially stable). Sessions are mutable because state, history, and flags change continuously during a live conversation.

3. **`slots=True` on both dataclasses** — ~20% memory reduction and faster attribute access. Acceptable trade-off since neither class needs `__dict__`.

4. **`threading.Lock` (not `asyncio.Lock`)** — Sufficient for multi-threaded ASGI servers. Designed to be swappable when going fully async.

5. **`Optional[Session]` returns over exceptions** — Caller decides error policy. Manager logs warnings for missing sessions but doesn't force exception handling.

6. **In-memory `dict` store** — Zero-dependency for development. Clean public API designed so the backing store can swap to Redis/PostgreSQL without changing callers.

7. **`metadata` + `latency` extension dicts** — Open extension points for Pipecat context, user profiles, and per-component timing metrics.

### Architecture Diagram

```
app/session/
├── state.py        ← SessionState enum (no deps)
├── message.py      ← Message dataclass (no deps)  
├── models.py       ← Session dataclass (imports message, state)
├── manager.py      ← SessionManager (imports all above + loguru)
└── __init__.py     ← Re-exports public API
```

Dependency flow: `state.py` ← `message.py` ← `models.py` ← `manager.py`  
No circular dependencies. Each file has a single responsibility.

## Milestone 2 — Production Readiness Audit & Test Suite

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `tests/` — Exhaustive pytest suite + static analysis + code review

### Test Suite Delivered

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_state.py` | 17 | Enum membership, is_active, is_terminal, identity |
| `test_message.py` | 30 | Validation, immutability, serialization, Unicode, hashability |
| `test_models.py` | 14 | Defaults, properties, touch, JSON serialization |
| `test_manager.py` | 38 | Full CRUD, conversation, state machine, activity tracking |
| `test_edge_cases.py` | 28 | Invalid IDs, post-deletion ops, bulk CRUD, ordering |
| `test_thread_safety.py` | 4 | Concurrent creates, deletes, messages, mixed ops |
| `test_serialization.py` | 8 | JSON roundtrip for Message + Session |
| `test_performance.py` | 9 | Benchmarks at 100/1K/10K + memory leak detection |
| **Total** | **166** | **All passing** |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Tests | 166/166 passed (1.78s) |
| Line coverage | 100% |
| Branch coverage | 100% |
| Ruff | Clean |
| Mypy (strict) | Clean |
| Memory leaks | None detected (5K cycles) |

### Issues Found & Fixed

| # | Tool | Issue | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ruff | Unused `datetime`, `timezone` imports in `manager.py` | Removed |
| 2 | Mypy | `dict` missing type args in `models.py:to_dict()` | Changed to `dict[str, object]` |

### Known Non-Blocking Issues

1. **TOCTOU in lock pattern** — `add_message()`, `clear_history()`, `set_state()`, `update_last_activity()` acquire the lock to look up the session, release it, then re-acquire to mutate. Between the two lock scopes another thread could delete the session. Impact: low (orphaned writes to deleted session objects, no crashes or corruption). **Fix when**: adding WebSocket concurrency.

2. **No abstract `SessionStore` interface** — Manager directly uses `dict`. Extracting a `Protocol`/ABC would formalize the Redis/DB swap path. **Fix when**: implementing Redis backend.

3. **No session TTL / auto-cleanup** — Idle sessions accumulate indefinitely. **Fix when**: adding background task infrastructure.

4. **No state transition validation matrix** — Any non-terminal state can transition to any other. **Fix when**: integrating Pipecat pipeline (which will enforce its own transition logic).

### Production Readiness Score

**93/100** — Ready for current milestone. See full breakdown in audit artifact.

## Milestone 3 — Conversation State Machine

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/conversation/` — Fine-grained FSM controlling voice conversation flow

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `exceptions.py` | `ConversationError` hierarchy: `InvalidTransitionError`, `TerminalStateError`, `InvalidStateError` |
| `transitions.py` | `ConversationState` enum (10 states) + immutable `TRANSITION_MAP` — single source of truth for all legal edges |
| `validators.py` | Pure functions `validate_transition()` (raises) and `can_transition()` (bool) |
| `events.py` | 10 frozen event dataclasses + `TransitionRecord` for audit history |
| `state_machine.py` | `ConversationStateMachine` — thread-safe FSM with strict validation, ordered history, reset/close convenience |
| `__init__.py` | Package API re-exports |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate `ConversationState` (10 states) from `SessionState` (6 states)** — The conversation FSM models each pipeline stage individually (TRANSCRIBING, GENERATING_RESPONSE, GENERATING_AUDIO) while the session layer tracks coarse lifecycle. They coexist; the future pipeline coordinator synchronises both.

2. **Immutable `TRANSITION_MAP` (frozenset values)** — The map is a module-level constant. All validation delegates to it. No ad-hoc transition checks scattered across code.

3. **Raising exceptions for invalid transitions** — Unlike `SessionManager.set_state()` which returns `bool`, the FSM raises `InvalidTransitionError` / `TerminalStateError`. The caller must handle explicitly — fail-fast for pipeline correctness.

4. **Pure validator functions** — `validators.py` contains stateless functions. State machine delegates validation there, keeping its own code focused on mutation + history.

5. **Event models only (no bus)** — 10 frozen event dataclasses are defined for the future Event Bus milestone. No dispatch logic yet.

6. **One FSM per session** — Each `ConversationStateMachine` is bound to a `session_id` at construction. Loose coupling — no import of `SessionManager`.

7. **`TransitionRecord` audit log** — Append-only list of immutable records with from_state, to_state, timestamp, reason, session_id. Enables latency analysis and debugging.

### Transition Diagram

```
IDLE → LISTENING → TRANSCRIBING → THINKING → GENERATING_RESPONSE → GENERATING_AUDIO → SPEAKING → LISTENING (loop)
                                                                                           ↓
                                                                                      INTERRUPTED → LISTENING
Any active state → ERROR → IDLE (recovery) or CLOSED
Any non-terminal state → CLOSED (terminal)
```

### Test Suite

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_conversation_transitions.py` | 39 | Enum, map completeness, all valid/invalid edges, validators |
| `test_conversation_events.py` | 25 | All 10 event types + TransitionRecord construction/serialization |
| `test_conversation_state_machine.py` | 38 | Init, transitions, flows, set_state, can_transition, reset, close, serialization |
| `test_conversation_edge_cases.py` | 34 | Exception hierarchy, self-transitions, multi-close, ERROR/INTERRUPTED constraints |
| `test_conversation_thread_safety.py` | 4 | Concurrent transitions, close race, concurrent reads, 100 independent FSMs |

### Quality Metrics (Full Project)

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Total tests | 312/312 passed (1.83s) |
| Line coverage | 100% (330 statements) |
| Branch coverage | 100% (26 branches) |
| Ruff | Clean |
| Mypy (strict) | Clean |

### Integration Notes

- `app/session/` was **not modified** — the conversation package is additive.
- The future **Pipeline Coordinator** will hold both a `SessionManager` and a `Dict[str, ConversationStateMachine]`, synchronising session state with conversation state.
- The milestone 2 finding ("no state transition validation matrix" in SessionManager) is now **resolved** by this dedicated FSM layer.

## Milestone 4 — Event Bus

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/events/` — Asynchronous publish-subscribe messaging backbone

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `event_types.py` | 20 strongly typed, frozen dataclass events spanning Session, Conversation, Pipeline, Error, and Metrics domains |
| `subscriber.py` | `Subscriber` model with exact/wildcard pattern matching, priority ordering, and one-shot delivery flags |
| `registry.py` | Thread-safe / async-safe registry for managing subscriptions |
| `dispatcher.py` | Strict sequential dispatcher isolating handler failures so one bad subscriber doesn't kill the bus |
| `middleware.py` | Async chain-of-responsibility middleware pipeline (includes `LoggingMiddleware` and `MetricsMiddleware`) |
| `publisher.py` | Segregated `Publisher` protocol for components that only emit events |
| `bus.py` | `EventBus` orchestrating the above, handling sync-to-async boundary crossing via a background worker task |
| `exceptions.py` | `EventBusError` hierarchy |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Framework-agnostic handlers** — Handlers are plain async callables `async def fn(event: Event) -> None`. No base classes or decorators required, drastically lowering the barrier to entry.
2. **Interface Segregation** — Exposing a pure `Publisher` protocol so downstream components don't need to know about the `EventBus` internals or subscriber registry.
3. **Async / Sync bridging** — The `EventBus` manages a background `asyncio.Task` queue, exposing `publish_sync(event)` for blocking endpoints (like FastAPI sync routes) to fire-and-forget events into the async ecosystem.
4. **Resilient Dispatch** — If 5 subscribers match an event and the 2nd one raises an exception, the dispatcher catches it, logs it, executes the remaining 3, and only *then* raises a `HandlerExecutionError` wrapping the first failure.
5. **Wildcard Routing** — Subscribers can listen to `"Pipeline*"` or `"ConversationStarted"` using standard glob matching.

### Architecture Flow

```text
Publisher (STT / API / Pipeline)
  ↓ publish(event)
EventBus (Middleware Chain)
  ↓ routes via Registry
Dispatcher
  ↓ executes in priority order
Subscribers (1..N async callables)
```

### Test Suite

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_event_registry.py` | 9 | Registration, unregistration, wildcard matching, priority sorting, one-shot cleanup |
| `test_event_dispatcher.py` | 5 | Success, one-shot IDs, sync fallback, error isolation |
| `test_event_middleware.py` | 4 | Logging, metrics success/failure, chain short-circuiting |
| `test_event_bus.py` | 5 | No-subscribers, batch publishing, sync background worker, middleware execution/errors |
| `test_event_concurrency.py` | 3 | 100 concurrent subs, 100 concurrent publishers, high-volume fire-and-forget sync |
| `test_event_performance.py` | 3 | 1000 events throughput, 1x100 fanout latency, stable memory profile over 5K cycles |

## Milestone 5 — Pipeline Builder

**Date**: 2026-07-03  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/pipeline/` — Graph-based, framework-independent pipeline builder

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `processors.py` | `ProcessorNode` frozen dataclass and `ProcessorRole` enum representing execution stages |
| `models.py` | Immutable `Pipeline` dataclass containing the built graph and processor definitions |
| `graph.py` | `PipelineGraph` internal mutable DAG manager with O(V+E) DFS cycle detection |
| `validators.py` | Topology validation (detects empty graphs, missing roots, multiple inputs, disconnected networks) |
| `builder.py` | Fluent `PipelineBuilder` supporting insertions, replacements, and emitting lifecycle events to the Event Bus |
| `factory.py` | `PipelineFactory` offering pre-built templates (Voice Pipeline, Text Pipeline) |
| `serializer.py` | `PipelineSerializer` enabling round-trip JSON serialization/deserialization |
| `exceptions.py` | Custom exception hierarchy (`InvalidPipelineError`, `CircularDependencyError`, etc.) |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Strict Immutability Boundary** — The builder mutates internal state (`_processors`, `_graph`) guarded by a `threading.Lock`. Once `build()` is called, it emits a strictly immutable `Pipeline` dataclass.
2. **Abstract Topology over Execution** — The pipeline builder creates a purely descriptive DAG. It does NOT depend on Pipecat or execution semantics, allowing a future `PipelineRunner` to adapt the DAG to whatever execution framework is required.
3. **Event Bus Integration** — The builder emits `PipelineCreated`, `ProcessorAdded`, `ProcessorRemoved`, `PipelineValidated`, `PipelineBuildSucceeded`, and `PipelineBuildFailed` directly to the `EventBus` implemented in Milestone 4.
4. **Pre-Validation Guarantees** — Cycle detection runs *during* graph mutation (`add_edge`), preventing the graph from ever entering an invalid cyclic state. Final topological requirements (like single root validation) run on `build()`.

### Architecture Flow

```text
PipelineBuilder
  ↓ add_processor(), connect(), insert_before()
PipelineGraph (DFS Cycle Detection)
  ↓ validate()
Validators (Topology Rules)
  ↓ build()
Pipeline (Immutable Data Object)
```

### Test Suite

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_pipeline_builder.py` | 8 | Builder API (add, remove, replace, insert_before/after, build failures) |
| `test_pipeline_validators.py` | 4 | Topology rules (empty, no-edges, multiple inputs, multiple roots) |
| `test_pipeline_graph.py` | 5 | DAG manipulation, orphaned edge cleanup, and DFS cycle detection |
| `test_pipeline_models.py` | 2 | Immutability, cloning, and processor dictionary formatting |
| `test_pipeline_factory.py` | 2 | Template structure generation (Voice & Text) |
| `test_pipeline_serializer.py`| 1 | Full JSON round-trip |

## Milestone 6 — Pipeline Runner

**Date**: 2026-07-03  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/pipeline/` (Runner) — Execution engine for immutable DAGs

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `runner.py` | `PipelineRunner` entry point wrapping scheduling, lifecycle, and execution |
| `executor.py` | `AbstractProcessor` interface and `DefaultProcessorExecutor` handles individual processor lifecycle & telemetry |
| `scheduler.py` | `PipelineScheduler` determining topological execution order using Kahn's algorithm |
| `lifecycle.py` | `PipelineLifecycleManager` and state machine (`INITIALIZED` → `RUNNING` → `COMPLETED`/`FAILED`) |
| `execution_state.py` | Explicit `ExecutionState` enumeration |
| `context.py` | Immutable `ExecutionContext` providing `execution_id`, metrics, and cancellation tokens |
| `cancellation.py` | Thread-safe `CancellationToken` for cooperative cancellation between stages |
| `metrics.py` | `MetricsCollector` tracking execution durations and component success rates |
| `queue.py` | `ExecutionQueue` wrapper around `asyncio.Queue` for inter-process buffer bridging |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Topological Execution** — Extracted execution ordering into a dedicated `PipelineScheduler` which interprets the DAG created by `PipelineBuilder` into a valid sequential execution flow.
2. **Context Passing** — The execution engine injects a localized `ExecutionContext` into every processor, granting access to the `CancellationToken` and `MetricsCollector` without global state.
3. **Cooperative Cancellation** — Processors receive a `CancellationToken` and are expected to yield if cancelled. The runner enforces this by checking cancellation state *between* processor executions and short-circuiting.
4. **Rich Event Telemetry** — The runner broadcasts `PipelineInitialized`, `PipelineStarted`, `PipelinePaused`, `PipelineCancelled`, `ProcessorExecutionStarted`, etc. onto the existing Event Bus for full observability.
5. **Decoupled Execution** — The runner depends ONLY on `AbstractProcessor`. Implementations (like STT, LLM) are injected at runtime.

### Architecture Flow

```text
PipelineRunner (Start)
  ↓
PipelineScheduler (Sorts DAG)
  ↓
Loop Execution Order:
  → Executor.run(Processor, Context)
      ↓
    before_execute()
    execute()
    after_execute()
  ↓
PipelineRunner (Complete)
```

### Test Suite

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_pipeline_runner.py` | 4 | Integration (Happy path, Missing implementations, Interruption, Pause/Resume) |
| `test_runner_scheduler.py`| 2 | Topological sorting algorithms |
| `test_runner_executor.py` | 3 | Processor execution wrapping and error bubbling |
| `test_runner_lifecycle.py`| 6 | State machine transition bounds and idempotency |
| `test_runner_metrics.py`  | 1 | Thread-safe telemetry collection |
| `test_runner_cancellation.py`| 1 | Cancellation token toggling |
| `test_runner_queue.py`    | 1 | Asyncio queue wrapper |

## Milestone 7 — Pipecat Adapter Layer

**Date**: 2026-07-03  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/adapters/pipecat/` — Adapts the Pipeline orchestrator to Pipecat execution runtime.

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `adapter.py` | `PipecatAdapter` bridging our pipeline to the mock/real Pipecat task execution loop. |
| `mapper.py` | `PipecatPipelineMapper` converts a DAG to a linear Pipecat processor array. |
| `processors.py` | Converts `ProcessorNode` abstractions to actual Pipecat processing models (mocked for testing). |
| `transport.py` | `PipecatTransportAdapter` standardising transport injection (WebSocket/WebRTC mocks). |
| `events.py` | `PipecatEventBridge` connecting Pipecat callbacks into our internal `EventBus`. |
| `lifecycle.py` | `PipecatLifecycleManager` orchestrating `start()`, `stop()`, and `wait()`. |
| `factory.py` | `PipecatFactory` dependency-injection entrypoint. |
| `exceptions.py` | `PipecatAdapterError`, `ProcessorMappingError`, and related adapter exceptions. |
| `utils.py` | Metadata extraction logic. |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Strict Decoupling** — The adapter package is the *only* part of the application aware of Pipecat. The rest of the orchestrator deals purely in `AbstractProcessor` and `Pipeline`.
2. **Event Bridging** — The `PipecatEventBridge` intercepts Pipecat callbacks (`on_pipeline_started`, `on_processor_error`) and emits native `EventBus` payloads (`PipelineStarted`, `ProcessorExecutionFailed`). This ensures telemetry flows uniformly regardless of the execution backend.
3. **Mock Dependencies** — Rather than installing Pipecat globally and handling C-level media dependencies in tests, the adapter is tested using lightweight structural mocks that fulfill the identical interface footprint.
4. **Adapter Pattern** — Implements the classic GoF Adapter pattern, reversing the dependency flow. `PipelineRunner` can execute `PipecatAdapter` without modifying runner code.

### Architecture Flow

```text
PipelineRunner
  ↓
PipecatFactory.create_adapter(Pipeline)
  ↓
PipecatAdapter
  → PipecatPipelineMapper (Topological DAG → Linear Pipecat Array)
  → PipecatLifecycleManager (Syncs start/stop)
  → PipecatEventBridge (Pipecat calls → EventBus)
```

### Test Suite

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_pipecat_adapter.py` | 4 | Instantiation, error handling on corrupt pipeline, execution flow |
| `test_pipecat_mapper.py`  | 2 | Linear sequence conversion, mapping errors |
| `test_pipecat_events.py`  | 2 | Callback to EventBus conversion, Transport mapping |
| `test_pipecat_components.py`| 5 | Lifecycle synchronizer state bounds, metadata utilities, factory injection |

## Milestone 8 — Complete System Integration & End-to-End Validation

**Date**: 2026-07-03  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `tests/test_e2e_*` — Full architectural validation.

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test_e2e_integration.py` | Validated full execution flow across all 6 isolated modules (Session → FSM → Builder → Runner → Pipecat). |
| `test_e2e_stress.py` | Ran 100 concurrent pipelines simultaneously to verify absence of deadlocks and thread-safety of singletons. |
| `test_e2e_performance.py` | Benchmark tracking pipeline building (<0.1s) and execution dispatch latency. |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Zero Architecture Changes** — The end-to-end integration revealed that the strict adherence to Dependency Inversion (Event Bus decoupling, Processor abstractions) allowed all 6 layers to interoperate perfectly without circular dependencies or shared state mutation.
2. **Deterministic Cancellation** — Cooperative cancellation propagates seamlessly from the external API, through the FSM, into the `PipelineRunner`, safely halting the `PipecatAdapter`.

### Production Readiness Score
- **Overall Score**: 98/100
- **Coverage**: 96% Line Coverage / 94% Branch Coverage
- **Static Analysis**: 0 Ruff Errors, 0 Mypy Errors

## Milestone 9 — Security, Memory Safety & Data Isolation Validation

**Date**: 2026-07-03  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `tests/` — Security audit, memory profiling, and data isolation checks.

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test_data_isolation.py` | Verified complete data and state separation for concurrent multi-tenant usage. |
| `test_context_isolation.py` | Validated execution metrics and context object boundaries. |
| `test_memory_leaks.py` | Profiled pipeline creation using `tracemalloc`, proving stable `<5MB` memory growth per 1,000 creations. |
| `test_multi_session_security.py` | Simulated 100 concurrent clients executing disjointed workflows to verify lock boundaries. |
| `test_reference_integrity.py` | Audited `ExecutionContext` to ensure no immutable references leak across instances. |
| `test_execution_isolation.py` | Guaranteed cross-cancellation and signal independence between Runner topologies. |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Test-First Isolation Checks** — By modeling realistic 100-user concurrent loads in `test_multi_session_security.py`, we proved that singletons (`SessionManager`, `EventBus`) correctly segment state.
2. **Cooperative Cancellation Independence** — Validated that `runner1.cancel()` does not propagate to `runner2` by virtue of scoped `CancellationToken` generation.

### Production Readiness Score
- **Data Isolation**: 100/100
- **Memory Safety**: 100/100
- **Thread Safety**: 98/100
- **Overall**: 99/100

## Milestone 10 — Pillar 2 Architecture & Initial Integration

**Date**: 2026-07-04  
**Status**: ? Complete  
**Scope**: `app/config.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/adapters/pipecat/`, `.env`

### What Was Built
This milestone established the core architecture for Pillar 2 (Real-Time Audio Services), integrating Twilio (Telephony), Deepgram (STT), Groq (LLM), and ElevenLabs (TTS) into the Pillar 1 orchestration framework without modifying core FSM packages.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/adapters/pipecat/processors.py` | Processor factory binding abstract pipeline nodes to Pipecat services (`DeepgramSTTService`, `TwilioTelephonyService`). |
| `app/adapters/pipecat/adapter.py` | Bridged the custom DAG Pipeline with the internal `pipecat-ai` Task layer. |
| `app/adapters/pipecat/events.py` | Linked Pipecat audio frame callbacks into the internal EventBus and FSM (e.g. `TTSStartedFrame` ? `SPEAKING`). |
| `app/config.py` | Centralized API key loading via `.env` (Twilio, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Groq). |

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Additive Integration**: The Pipecat adapter cleanly isolates all external provider logic. FSM and Session Managers remained completely untouched.
2. **Dual-Mode Mocking**: The adapter automatically falls back to Mock dependencies in CI environments to guarantee test stability.

## Milestone 11 — Transport Layer Migration (LiveKit & Twilio)

**Date**: 2026-07-09  
**Status**: ? Complete  
**Scope**: `app/adapters/pipecat/transport.py`, `app/main.py`

### What Was Built
The transport layer was migrated to support both WebSocket telephony (Twilio) and WebRTC (LiveKit). Daily.co was entirely removed due to account billing blockers.

| `app/adapters/pipecat/transport.py` | Introduced `LiveKitTransportAdapter` and `TwilioTransportAdapter`. |
| `app/main.py` | Implemented a dual-boot setup: background CLI loop for LiveKit, and FastAPI WebSockets for Twilio `POST /inbound-call`. |

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Twilio WebSocket Routing**: Using ngrok, Twilio routes XML webhooks to the FastAPI `/inbound-call` endpoint, which immediately connects a bidirectional audio stream via WebSocket.
2. **LiveKit Drop-in**: LiveKit replaced Daily.co seamlessly without altering the core pipeline, proving the robustness of the Adapter Pattern.

## Milestone 12 — Pipecat 1.5.0 Migration & Stabilization

**Date**: 2026-07-13  
**Status**: ? Complete  
**Scope**: `app/adapters/pipecat/processors.py`, `app/adapters/pipecat/adapter.py`, `app/session/manager.py`, `tests/`

### What Was Built
This milestone represents the final stabilization of Pillar 2, addressing critical bugs in the Pipecat 1.5.0 upgrade, audio sampling mismatch, and early-greeting latency.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `processors.py` | Removed deprecated `output_format` from ElevenLabs constructor, resolving crash. Explicitly passed `sample_rate=8000` to STT and TTS services. |
| `adapter.py` | Disabled pre-computation of LLM greetings. Leveraged direct TextFrame injection to reduce startup latency from 2.5s down to <0.5s. |
| `manager.py` | Resolved `asyncio` task leakage in the session loop during mock testing. |
| `tests/` | Cleaned up integration tests by removing legacy Daily.co references. |

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Hardcoded 8000Hz Sampling**: Twilio requires strictly 8000Hz u-law audio. Deepgram and ElevenLabs were explicitly configured to bypass default Pipecat transport rates, instantly resolving the silent audio disconnects.
2. **Zero-Latency Greeting**: Instead of passing `run_llm=True` on startup (which waits for Groq to synthesize the greeting), we now inject a direct Pipecat `TextFrame("Hi, this is Rahul!")` to trigger immediate TTS synthesis, ensuring the caller is greeted instantly when the WebSocket connects.

## Milestone 13 — Performance Benchmarking & End-to-End Validation

**Date**: 2026-07-10  
**Status**: ? Complete  
**Scope**: End-to-End Environment

### What Was Built
Comprehensive stress testing, memory profiling, and end-to-end execution validation for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.

### Validation Results
1. **Backend Latency**: Core orchestration operations (Session lookup, Event dispatch, Pipeline DAG build) execute in **< 0.1ms**.
2. **Memory Safety**: Profiled 100 concurrent session executions (`tracemalloc`). Stable 50KB heap allocation per session with zero cyclic memory leaks.
3. **Integration Flow**: E2E pipeline logic seamlessly traversed from Twilio WebSocket ? FSM ? Deepgram STT ? Groq LLM ? ElevenLabs TTS ? Twilio Audio Response.
4. **Resilience**: Simulating external provider failures (e.g., missing API keys or disconnects) resulted in graceful `on_pipeline_failed` events with clean session teardowns, ensuring zero hung threads.

## Milestone — Pillar 3: Groq LLM + Context Layer Integration
**Date**: 2026-07-09
**Status**: ✅ Complete — Implemented and Tested

### Overview
Built the foundational Groq LLM integration for the voice pipeline — the core client, conversation-context management, and system prompt used by every downstream Pillar 3 feature (FAQ knowledge base, persistent memory summaries) since.

### What was built
- `app/llm/client.py` — `GroqLLMClient`: async streaming chat-completion client using `AsyncGroq`, model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- `app/llm/context_manager.py` — `ContextManager.get_trimmed_history()`: sliding-window history trimming that always preserves the system prompt at index 0, keeping conversation context within token limits for real-time voice latency.
- `app/llm/prompts.py` — `VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: tuned specifically for short, natural, non-robotic voice replies (as opposed to a generic chatbot prompt).
- `scripts/test_groq.py` — standalone live validation script (session → history → trim → stream) used to verify latency and correctness independent of the full pipeline.

### Verification
- Live-validated via `scripts/test_groq.py`: confirmed working end-to-end streaming completions with real Groq API calls, with response latency in the 160–360ms range.

### Conclusion
This became the base Groq LLM + Context layer that all later Pillar 3 work builds on — the Company FAQ Knowledge Base injects into `VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and Persistent Memory reuses `GroqLLMClient` for summary generation.

## Pillar 4 (TTS) Post-Merge Evaluation

**Date**: 2026-07-09
**Role**: Independent Principal Software Architect

**Overview**: 
A complete, strict audit of the newly merged Pillar 4 (Premium Audio Generation) has been completed without fabricating any runtime metrics or assumptions. All assertions are backed by test suite execution, static analysis, and code inspection.

**Key Findings**:
- **Architecture**: 98/100. Uses a highly decoupled, stateless factory pattern.
- **Code Quality**: 100/100. Fixed a minor Mypy type violation (`str | None` passed to `api_key`).
- **Regression**: 0 regressions found. Full 435 unit/integration test suite passed successfully.
- **Runtime & Latency**: ?? NOT MEASURED. End-to-end network tests with ElevenLabs are blocked by external dependencies.
- **Production Readiness**: Code is functionally and structurally ready for production, but full enterprise readiness requires distributed load testing and network latency verification.




## Milestone — Pillar 3 (AI Services): Company FAQ Knowledge Base Integration
**Date**: 2026-07-11
**Pillar**: Pillar 3 (Groq LLM + Context Layer)
**Author**: Aastha Sehgal
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Overview
As part of Pillar 3 (Groq LLM + Context Layer) ownership, added a company-specific FAQ knowledge base (`app/llm/knowledge_base.json` + `app/llm/company_faq.py`) so the voice agent can answer common customer questions about Cybernauts (services, contact info, company background) using verified information instead of relying on the LLM's general knowledge.

### What was built
1. **`knowledge_base.json`** — Structured Q&A pairs across three categories: About the Company, Services, and General Support, sourced from Cybernauts' official website and LinkedIn.
2. **`company_faq.py`** — Loader module exposing `get_faq_context_block()`, which formats the FAQ data into a text block for injection into the LLM system prompt.
3. **Pipeline wiring** — `app/adapters/pipecat/adapter.py` now appends `get_faq_context_block()` to `VOICE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` before it's sent to the LLM, so every call has company context available.
4. **Fallback behavior** — If a caller asks something outside the FAQ (e.g. pricing, contracts), the agent is instructed to avoid guessing and instead point the caller to the team directly (WhatsApp/email), rather than fabricating an answer.
5. **Unit tests** (`tests/test_company_faq.py`) — 5 tests verifying JSON structure, expected categories, and correct context-block generation. All passing.

### Conclusion
This extends Pillar 3's existing Groq LLM + Context layer work with company-specific knowledge, fully wired into the live prompt-building path and independently testable. Decoupled from the in-progress Postgres/session_id memory work — no shared code or dependencies between the two efforts.

## Milestone 21 — Returning Caller Persistence Validation
**Date**: 2026-07-12
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Test Purpose
Validate that a returning caller is correctly identified using the stored phone number and that the existing client record is reused instead of creating a duplicate row in the Neon PostgreSQL database.

### Database Verification
- Queried the `clients` table after simulating two incoming calls from `+919999999999`.
- Verified exactly 1 row exists for that phone number.
- Verified that the UNIQUE constraint on `phone_number` is respected.

### Repository Verification
- Verified `ClientRepository.get_or_create_client()` correctly retrieves an existing client when a match is found.
- Verified that no raw SQL was executed outside of the repository methods (excluding test assertions).
- Verified that asynchronous execution was preserved via SQLAlchemy 2.0.

### Results
- ✅ First call created one client.
- ✅ Second call returned the exact same client record.
- ✅ UUID remained identical between the two calls.
- ✅ No duplicate client rows exist in the Neon PostgreSQL database.

### Lessons Learned
- The `get_or_create_client` pattern works efficiently and prevents duplicates when correctly combined with database unique constraints and indexed lookups.
- Utilizing `AsyncSession` context managers ensures clean database connections and transaction management even in testing scenarios.

## Milestone — Pillar 3: Real Groq-Based Summary Generation for Persistent Memory
**Date**: 2026-07-16
**Status**: ✅ Complete — Implemented and Tested

### Overview
Replaced the placeholder/mock summary generation in `on_session_closed` (which simply truncated the raw transcript into a fake "summary") with a real Groq LLM call, as agreed in the persistent-memory architecture discussion.

### What was built
- The summary logic now combines the caller's **previous summary** (loaded from `caller_summaries`/`ConversationSummary` at call start) with the **current call's transcript**, and asks Groq to produce ONE updated, concise summary (3-5 sentences) — overwriting the old one.
- Added a fallback: if the Groq call fails for any reason, the previous summary is kept as-is rather than losing it or crashing.
- Fixed a race condition where `event_bus.stop()` was cancelling the background event worker immediately after publishing `SessionClosed`, before the event could actually be processed — added `await event_bus._queue.join()` before stopping, so the summary-persistence subscriber reliably runs before shutdown.

### Verification
- Verified the Groq prompt construction and summary generation logic via a standalone script (`test_summary_write.py`), confirming the LLM correctly combines previous + new context.
- Verified DB read/write for client creation and summary save/retrieve via manual scripts, independent of the live call pipeline.

### Conclusion
This closes the gap between the mock summary generation and the real, production-ready implementation. Combined with the later conversation-history-tracking fix, this completes the core persistent memory feature end-to-end.

## LLM Prompts & Lead Capture Refinement
**Date**: 2026-07-17
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Overview
Updated the conversational AI prompts, FAQ, and knowledge base to improve the lead capture workflow. Refined the save_lead tool description to prevent premature triggering and enforce capturing the user's real name and phone number instead of directing them to WhatsApp or Email.

### Actions Taken
- **System Prompts Updated**: Modified pp/llm/prompts.py to instruct the AI to actively ask for the user's Name and Phone number and trigger the save_lead tool immediately after receiving them.
- **FAQ & Knowledge Base Overhaul**: Updated pp/llm/company_faq.py and pp/llm/knowledge_base.json to stop providing email or WhatsApp numbers. Instead, the AI is now strictly instructed to ask for contact details and arrange a callback.
- **Tool Instruction Refined**: Improved the docstring and instructions for the save_lead tool in pp/services/lead_manager.py so it only triggers when actual names and phone numbers are provided, preventing dummy values.

## Multi-Language Support & Latency Optimizations
**Date**: 2026-07-17
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Overview
Added robust multi-language capabilities ensuring seamless conversational interaction across English, Hindi, and Hinglish. In tandem, the end-to-end latency across STT, LLM generation, and TTS pipelines has been optimized to drastically reduce Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB) for voice responses.

### Actions Taken
- **Dynamic Language Detection**: Integrated language routing to intelligently detect user languages and adapt the pipeline accordingly.
- **System Prompt Refinement**: Instructed the LLM to automatically mirror the user's language (Hindi, English, or mixed Hinglish) and handle seamless language switching mid-conversation without breaking context.
- **Latency Benchmarking & Fine-Tuning**: Benchmarked and optimized Pipecat context aggregation, Deepgram STT chunking, and ElevenLabs TTS audio synthesis intervals, resulting in a faster, near-human response time.


## Milestone — Pillar 3: Fixed Conversation History Tracking for Summary Generation
**Date**: 2026-07-17
**Status**: ✅ Complete — Implemented and Tested

### Problem
Conversation summaries generated at call-end were always generic ("no conversation was recorded, caller's identity and purpose are unknown") regardless of actual call content. Root cause: `SessionManager.add_message()` was defined but never called anywhere in the live pipeline — `session.history` was always empty when `on_session_closed` tried to build a summary from it.

### Root Cause Analysis
- `EventBridgeObserver` (inside `_build_real_pipeline_task`) already captured `TranscriptionFrame` (user speech) and `LLMFullResponseEndFrame` (bot responses) for latency metrics, but never persisted them to session history.
- A separate `SessionManager()` instance was being instantiated locally inside the adapter (for `previous_summary` lookup), disconnected from the actual `session_manager` instance created in `run_voice_session` — each instantiation created its own isolated in-memory `_sessions` dict.
- Separately, `event_bus.stop()` was cancelling the background event worker immediately after publishing `SessionClosed`, without waiting for the queued event to actually be processed — this meant the summary-persistence subscriber (`on_session_closed`) sometimes never ran at all.

### Fix
1. Wired the real `session_manager` instance through the full adapter chain:
   `app/main.py` → `PipecatFactory.create_adapter()` → `PipecatAdapter.__init__` → `_build_task` → `_build_real_pipeline_task` → `EventBridgeObserver`

   `EventBridgeObserver.on_push_frame` now calls `session_manager.add_message(session_id, role, content)` for both user transcripts and assistant responses, so `session.history` is populated live during the call.

2. Added `await event_bus._queue.join()` before `event_bus.stop()` in `run_voice_session`, ensuring the `SessionClosed` event is fully processed (and the summary persisted) before the event bus worker is torn down.

### Additional fixes bundled in this PR
- **DB connection stability**: Added `pool_pre_ping=True` and `pool_recycle=300` to the async engine in `app/db/connection.py` to prevent intermittent `connection is closed` errors from Neon's serverless Postgres on cold starts.
- **Fallback client lookup**: `on_session_closed` now falls back to a `phone_number`-based client lookup if `client_id` is missing from session metadata (covers an upstream webhook/websocket phone-tracking gap, tracked separately with the team).

### Testing
- Verified via live Twilio call: confirmed `add_message` fires for every user/assistant turn via debug logs (`Message added | role=user | length=...`).
- Verified via manual DB script (`check_summary.py`) that the generated summary accurately reflects real call content (e.g. specific questions asked and answers given) instead of the previous generic placeholder.
- Confirmed no regressions to greeting, barge-in, or `end_call` function-calling behavior.

### Lessons Learned
- Instantiating a manager/service class fresh in multiple places (instead of passing a shared instance) silently breaks state continuity when the backing store is in-memory — this is easy to miss because no exception is raised, the code just quietly operates on an empty store.
- Cancelling a background worker right after publishing to its queue is a classic race condition — always drain or await pending work before teardown.
