## Milestone 1 — Session Management Layer

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/session/` — Core session lifecycle and conversation state management

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `state.py` | `SessionState` enum — 6 states (IDLE → LISTENING → THINKING → SPEAKING → INTERRUPTED → CLOSED) with `is_active()` / `is_terminal()` helpers |
| `message.py` | Frozen `Message` dataclass — immutable, validated, LLM-API-compatible `to_dict()` |
| `models.py` | Mutable `Session` dataclass — UUID, timestamps, history, speaking flags, metadata, latency |
| `manager.py` | `SessionManager` — thread-safe CRUD, conversation ops, state transitions, Loguru logging |
| `__init__.py` | Package API surface with `__all__` exports |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **`Literal["system", "user", "assistant"]` for Role** — Serializes directly to LLM chat-completion format without `.value` calls. Chose Literal over Enum deliberately.

2. **`frozen=True` on Message, mutable Session** — Messages are immutable once created (thread-safe, referentially stable). Sessions are mutable because state, history, and flags change continuously during a live conversation.

3. **`slots=True` on both dataclasses** — ~20% memory reduction and faster attribute access. Acceptable trade-off since neither class needs `__dict__`.

4. **`threading.Lock` (not `asyncio.Lock`)** — Sufficient for multi-threaded ASGI servers. Designed to be swappable when going fully async.

5. **`Optional[Session]` returns over exceptions** — Caller decides error policy. Manager logs warnings for missing sessions but doesn't force exception handling.

6. **In-memory `dict` store** — Zero-dependency for development. Clean public API designed so the backing store can swap to Redis/PostgreSQL without changing callers.

7. **`metadata` + `latency` extension dicts** — Open extension points for Pipecat context, user profiles, and per-component timing metrics.

### Architecture Diagram

```
app/session/
├── state.py        ← SessionState enum (no deps)
├── message.py      ← Message dataclass (no deps)  
├── models.py       ← Session dataclass (imports message, state)
├── manager.py      ← SessionManager (imports all above + loguru)
└── __init__.py     ← Re-exports public API
```

Dependency flow: `state.py` ← `message.py` ← `models.py` ← `manager.py`  
No circular dependencies. Each file has a single responsibility.

## Milestone 2 — Production Readiness Audit & Test Suite

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `tests/` — Exhaustive pytest suite + static analysis + code review

### Test Suite Delivered

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_state.py` | 17 | Enum membership, is_active, is_terminal, identity |
| `test_message.py` | 30 | Validation, immutability, serialization, Unicode, hashability |
| `test_models.py` | 14 | Defaults, properties, touch, JSON serialization |
| `test_manager.py` | 38 | Full CRUD, conversation, state machine, activity tracking |
| `test_edge_cases.py` | 28 | Invalid IDs, post-deletion ops, bulk CRUD, ordering |
| `test_thread_safety.py` | 4 | Concurrent creates, deletes, messages, mixed ops |
| `test_serialization.py` | 8 | JSON roundtrip for Message + Session |
| `test_performance.py` | 9 | Benchmarks at 100/1K/10K + memory leak detection |
| **Total** | **166** | **All passing** |

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Tests | 166/166 passed (1.78s) |
| Line coverage | 100% |
| Branch coverage | 100% |
| Ruff | Clean |
| Mypy (strict) | Clean |
| Memory leaks | None detected (5K cycles) |

### Issues Found & Fixed

| # | Tool | Issue | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ruff | Unused `datetime`, `timezone` imports in `manager.py` | Removed |
| 2 | Mypy | `dict` missing type args in `models.py:to_dict()` | Changed to `dict[str, object]` |

### Known Non-Blocking Issues

1. **TOCTOU in lock pattern** — `add_message()`, `clear_history()`, `set_state()`, `update_last_activity()` acquire the lock to look up the session, release it, then re-acquire to mutate. Between the two lock scopes another thread could delete the session. Impact: low (orphaned writes to deleted session objects, no crashes or corruption). **Fix when**: adding WebSocket concurrency.

2. **No abstract `SessionStore` interface** — Manager directly uses `dict`. Extracting a `Protocol`/ABC would formalize the Redis/DB swap path. **Fix when**: implementing Redis backend.

3. **No session TTL / auto-cleanup** — Idle sessions accumulate indefinitely. **Fix when**: adding background task infrastructure.

4. **No state transition validation matrix** — Any non-terminal state can transition to any other. **Fix when**: integrating Pipecat pipeline (which will enforce its own transition logic).

### Production Readiness Score

**93/100** — Ready for current milestone. See full breakdown in audit artifact.

## Milestone 3 — Conversation State Machine

**Date**: 2026-07-02  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Scope**: `app/conversation/` — Fine-grained FSM controlling voice conversation flow

### What Was Built

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `exceptions.py` | `ConversationError` hierarchy: `InvalidTransitionError`, `TerminalStateError`, `InvalidStateError` |
| `transitions.py` | `ConversationState` enum (10 states) + immutable `TRANSITION_MAP` — single source of truth for all legal edges |
| `validators.py` | Pure functions `validate_transition()` (raises) and `can_transition()` (bool) |
| `events.py` | 10 frozen event dataclasses + `TransitionRecord` for audit history |
| `state_machine.py` | `ConversationStateMachine` — thread-safe FSM with strict validation, ordered history, reset/close convenience |
| `__init__.py` | Package API re-exports |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate `ConversationState` (10 states) from `SessionState` (6 states)** — The conversation FSM models each pipeline stage individually (TRANSCRIBING, GENERATING_RESPONSE, GENERATING_AUDIO) while the session layer tracks coarse lifecycle. They coexist; the future pipeline coordinator synchronises both.

2. **Immutable `TRANSITION_MAP` (frozenset values)** — The map is a module-level constant. All validation delegates to it. No ad-hoc transition checks scattered across code.

3. **Raising exceptions for invalid transitions** — Unlike `SessionManager.set_state()` which returns `bool`, the FSM raises `InvalidTransitionError` / `TerminalStateError`. The caller must handle explicitly — fail-fast for pipeline correctness.

4. **Pure validator functions** — `validators.py` contains stateless functions. State machine delegates validation there, keeping its own code focused on mutation + history.

5. **Event models only (no bus)** — 10 frozen event dataclasses are defined for the future Event Bus milestone. No dispatch logic yet.

6. **One FSM per session** — Each `ConversationStateMachine` is bound to a `session_id` at construction. Loose coupling — no import of `SessionManager`.

7. **`TransitionRecord` audit log** — Append-only list of immutable records with from_state, to_state, timestamp, reason, session_id. Enables latency analysis and debugging.

### Transition Diagram

```
IDLE → LISTENING → TRANSCRIBING → THINKING → GENERATING_RESPONSE → GENERATING_AUDIO → SPEAKING → LISTENING (loop)
                                                                                           ↓
                                                                                      INTERRUPTED → LISTENING
Any active state → ERROR → IDLE (recovery) or CLOSED
Any non-terminal state → CLOSED (terminal)
```

### Test Suite

| File | Tests | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `test_conversation_transitions.py` | 39 | Enum, map completeness, all valid/invalid edges, validators |
| `test_conversation_events.py` | 25 | All 10 event types + TransitionRecord construction/serialization |
| `test_conversation_state_machine.py` | 38 | Init, transitions, flows, set_state, can_transition, reset, close, serialization |
| `test_conversation_edge_cases.py` | 34 | Exception hierarchy, self-transitions, multi-close, ERROR/INTERRUPTED constraints |
| `test_conversation_thread_safety.py` | 4 | Concurrent transitions, close race, concurrent reads, 100 independent FSMs |

### Quality Metrics (Full Project)

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Total tests | 312/312 passed (1.83s) |
| Line coverage | 100% (330 statements) |
| Branch coverage | 100% (26 branches) |
| Ruff | Clean |
| Mypy (strict) | Clean |

### Integration Notes

- `app/session/` was **not modified** — the conversation package is additive.
- The future **Pipeline Coordinator** will hold both a `SessionManager` and a `Dict[str, ConversationStateMachine]`, synchronising session state with conversation state.
- The milestone 2 finding ("no state transition validation matrix" in SessionManager) is now **resolved** by this dedicated FSM layer.
